## Document 1: Python Programming

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.

Key features of Python include:
- Dynamic typing and automatic memory management
- Comprehensive standard library
- Support for multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, procedural)
- Large and active community

Python is widely used in:
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science and machine learning (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)
- Automation and scripting
- Scientific computing

## Document 2: Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of algorithms that can access data and learn from it.

Types of machine learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment

Common applications include:
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles

Popular ML frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn.
